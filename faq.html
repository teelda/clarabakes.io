Products that we sell in our store that come from outside sources contain no nuts, but packaging may be labelled " may contain traces of nuts " due to local, state and federal requirements.</p>

				<p>CLara Bakes requires one week notice for any and all custom ordered cakes.  A 50% deposit is required for all custom ordered cakes. Deposits are non-refundable and non-transferable.  Please note that we require 4 business days notice for any and all cancellations or changes EXCEPT cakes with fondant figurines.  Due to the time needed to create and dry these elements, cancellations will not be accepted after 7 days prior to the pickup date.</p>


				<h5>6. Do I need to make an appointment when ordering a custom cake? </h5>
				<p>An appointment is not needed for anything except Wedding Cakes. You can call or walk-in and any of our knowledgeable staff can help you.</p>

				<h5>7. How do you price out your cakes?</h5>

				<p>Our cakes are priced based on the size of the cake and the artwork. Please note that prices are subject to change due to the nature of our products. All of our cakes are custom designed and artwork pricing may vary.</p>

				 </p>





				<h5>10. Do you offer any other products for special dietary needs?</h5> 
				<p>Along with being a nut-free bakery we do offer a few products that are vegan, egg-free, gluten-free, or dairy-free. Please contact us for more specific information regarding ingredients that you may be sensitive to.</p>


				<h5>11. How do you color your buttercream? </h5>
				<p>We use the finest food coloring available to color our buttercream. Please keep in mind that excessive amounts of food coloring in our buttercream MAY stain and MAY change the flavor.</p>


				<h5>12. Can you match colors for my cake?</h5> 
				<p>If you provide a swatch or swatches, we will do our best to match to the color(s) as close as possible, but please keep in mind that due to food coloring limitations, we may not be able to match all colors and we cannot guarantee an exact.</p>


				<h5>13. Can I provide a picture for you to use to decorate my cake?</h5> 
				<p>Yes, of course! Please do keep in mind that all of our cakes are created freehand and, therefore, will not be an exact replica of any materials provided to us for duplication.</p> 


				<h5>14. Can you put a photograph or picture directly onto a cake?</h5> 
				<p>If you email your picture to us, we can print it on a sugar paper, creating an edible image. This edible image can go directly onto your cake.</p>

				<h5>15. Will my cake look exactly like the cakes that are on the website? </h5>
				<p>While every cake/image on our website has been created by Clara Bakes and has been done here at our location, not every cake will be an exact replica of the image. We pride ourselves on the fact that we are cake "artists" not just "cake decorators". With that said, every 'artists' has his/her style/technique of creating masterpieces. How we divide up our orders is by 'ability' not 'originality’ of cakes. Just like true artists, they have different talents & abilities. We recognize these differences and process our work to our talented staff by each of their own talents & abilities. Each cake is a ‘recreation’ not an ‘originality’.</p>

				<h5>16.Why do we need to give a weeks notice on custom orders?  That seems like a long time.</h5>
				<p>We like to explain to our customers that our ‘cake artists’ are no different than any other service/talent professionals. Just like hair dressers, each ‘artists’ books up during their week with the work load they are given. To ensure a custom cake, made by one of our talented team, we need advance notice so they can prioritize and give the correct amount of time needed for each cake creation they make.</p>

				<h5>17. For character cakes, do you hand draw the characters on the cake?</h5>
				<p>Depending on size, medium and other artwork for the cake, hand drawn characters may be an option.  Edible images are sometimes used and embellished if needed or to deliver the most accurate representation of the character.  Your cake artist will determine the best approach for your cake order.</p><hr>


				<h2>Weddings</h2>

The design fee will vary depending on the design you choose and the delivery fee will depend on your reception location. When meeting with any of our consultants, you will receive an estimate based on your custom designed cake.</p>

				<h5>2. What size of cake do I need? </h5>
				<p>Depending on the number of guests you’ll be having and how your cake is being served will determine the final size of your cake.</p>

				<h5>10. If I want ribbon on my wedding cake and my wedding cake is being ordered through my reception location, when do I need to provide the ribbon? </h5>

				 <h2>CARE GUIDE</h2>

				<p class="lead text-justify">Always hold a boxed cake by the bottom and keep level.  Do not stack anything on top of the box and keep propped open if taped that way.<br>

				All cakes and cupcakes must be refrigerated.  If the cake is wrapped, keep the wrapping intact while in the refrigerator.  Cakes are best served at room temperature.<br>

				All cakes must be transported in a cool vehicle.  Place product on a clean, flat surface. Do not place the cake on the seat, in the trunk, or any uneven surface.  Use of air conditioning is strongly recommended when transporting cake.  Never have heat on the cake.  Keep all windows closed, drive carefully and avoid braking quickly.<br>

				Cakes should always be displayed on a sturdy surface, and kept away from heat and direct sunlight.  If it gets too warm, it may sweat, melt or become structurally unsound.  Use a hot, dry knife to slice the cake.<br>

				Leftover cake is best stored in the refrigerator and enjoyed within 2 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.  We do not recommend freezing cream cheese, pastry cream or whipped cream.<br>

				Frostings, fondant and icing are tinted with food dye which may cause staining and/or a change in taste depending on color and shade.<br>

				Decoration may require the use of non edible materials such as, but not limited to, wooden dowels, lollipop sticks or floral wire for reinforcement.  Please remove all structural elements, fondant figurines, sugar flowers, and other decorations prior to service.<br>

				Please inspect all cakes prior to departing bakery.  Once cake is taken from the bakery, all responsibility belongs to the client. Due to the custom and personalized nature of our products, all orders are non-refundable once created.</p>
